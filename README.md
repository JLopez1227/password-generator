# Password-generator

## 
In this assignment starter code to a password generator was given to me. It was my task to implment JavaScript code to build a functioning Password Generator that gives you a secure password. Using JavaScript I added window prompts with criteria of what the user would like their password to include. I added vars of the possible characters that can be used in your password. I also added a copy button so that when the user's password is generated they can copy their new secure password.
