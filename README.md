# Password-generator

## 
In this assignment starter code to a password generator was given to me. It was my task to implment JavaScript code to build a functioning Password Generator that gives you a secure password. Using JavaScript I added "window confirms" with criteria of what the user would like their password to include. I added "vars" of the possible characters that can be used in your password. I also added "if statements" so that if the user wants a specfic criteria for their password it will concant array's resulting in a password that fits the user's wishes.

###
I added a "for loop" that ensures the password is random. I also had to create a function so that when you click the generate password button the password generates.
